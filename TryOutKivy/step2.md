## Initialize a directory for Kivy, build, and serve

This time we'll install a kivy starter and go from there.

Show Kivy help:

`kivy start --help`{{execute}}

The `kivy start` command will initialize an kivy directory.

`kivy start myApp blank --type=react `{{execute}}

then change directory into your new starter:

`cd myApp`{{execute}}

and continue to the next step.
