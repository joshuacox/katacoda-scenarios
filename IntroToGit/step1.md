## Spin up VM

This should have started automatically and should be progressing in the pane to the right -->

Note: you can click the commands below and they will be pasted and
executed into the terminal on the right.  However, if you want to learn
I recommend you type them.

`hostname`{{execute}}

^ This command will output the hostname of our VM.

`echo $SHELL`{{execute}}

^ This command will output the name of the running shell of our VM which
should be `bash`.

`whoami`{{execute}}

^ The `whoami` command will output your username.

`w`{{execute}}

^ The `w` command will output the usernames of all users currently
logged into the system.
