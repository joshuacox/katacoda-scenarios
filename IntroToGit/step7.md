# Creating your own repo

Let’s get you your own repo and make a static page.

If you don’t have a github account get one
[here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
it’s free.

Now make a [new repo](https://github.com/new).

First let’s make sure we are in our git directory in the home folder:

`cd ~/git`{{execute}}

Ok now let's clone that repo!
There is a link on the righthand side of the page, copy it, then `git clone` that link.

Here’s an example of what it might look like:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBID/YOURREPO.git
```
The output should look something like this:
```
Cloning into 'YOURREPO'...
