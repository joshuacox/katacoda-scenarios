# Creating your own repo 

Let’s get you your own repo and make a static page

If you don’t have a github account get one it’s free

now make a new repo, first let’s make sure we are in our git directory in the home folder
```
cd ~/git
```

ok now let's clone that repo! There is a link in the bottom righthand corner copy it then `git clone` that link

here’s an example of what it might look like:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBID/YOURREPO.git
```
the output should look something like this:
```
Cloning into 'YOURREPO'...
