## Welcome to the Intro to Git Scenario!

This is a scenario to introduce the basics of Git using the Command Line
Interface.  The virtual machine (VM) on the right will be using the Bash

same using most shells and operating systems, with slight differences
here and there.  But for the most part Bash should work pretty much the
same across all platforms.  So we'll start there.

(Fans of other shells feel free to fork this
repo and make another tutorial specifying the differences specific to
your shell.)
