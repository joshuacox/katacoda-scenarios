 Ok so that was git in 60 seconds (if you are a fast typist).

 What just went on?  

Let me be a bit more verbose with an intro of some very basic commands with a basic explanation after:

`pwd`{{execute}}

^ Print Working Directory (the "you are here" of unix land)

`mkdir dir_to_make`{{execute}}

^ make directory/folder named `dir_to_make`

`mv dir_to_make dir_to_cd_into`{{execute}}

^ move directory/folder named `dir_to_make` to be renamed to `dir_to_cd_into`

`cd dir_to_cd_into`{{execute}}

^ change directory (this is how you 'move' around the file system

`ls`{{execute}}

^ list the current directory i.e. show me what is in the current folder

`man ls`{{execute}}

^ “manual” gives the manual page for any command i.e. `man ls` will give the manual page for ls

`man git`{{execute}}

^ At some point you'll feel confident enough to just pull this page up for reference.
