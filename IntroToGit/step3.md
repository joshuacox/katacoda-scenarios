### WTF?!?!
 Ok so that was git in 60 seconds (if you are a fast typist). 

 What just went on?  

Let me be a bit more verbose with an intro of some very basic commands with a basic explanation after:
```
pwd
```
^ Print Working Directory (the "you are here" of unix land)
```
mkdir dir_to_make
```
^ make directory/folder named `dir_to_make`
```
cd
```
^ change directory (this is how you 'move' around the file system
```
ls
```
^ list the current directory i.e. show me what is in the current folder
```
man
```
^ “manual” gives the manual page for any command i.e. `man ls` will give the manual page for ls
```
man git
```
^ At some point you'll feel confident enough to just pull this page up for reference, not just yet
