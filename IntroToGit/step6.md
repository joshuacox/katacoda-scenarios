# Permanent home for git

Okay from here letâ€™s make a git directory in our home and start cloning repos from a git repo

`cd`{{execute}}

^ given no arguments cd will take you home

`mkdir git`{{execute}}

^ there is no output for this command

`cd git`{{execute}}

^ again no output on this command so long as there are no errors
but let's prove to ourselves that we changed directories with `pwd`

`pwd`{{execute}}

Click the continue button to continue.
