# Permanent home for git

Okay from here letâ€™s make a git directory in our home and start cloning repos from a git repo
```
cd
```
^ given no arguments cd will take you home
```
pwd
```
```
mkdir git
```
^ there is no output for this command
```
cd git
```
^ again no output on this command so long as there are no errors
but let's prove to ourselves that we changed directories with `pwd`
```
pwd
```
