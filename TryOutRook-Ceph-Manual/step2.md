## Try Out Rook

Now let's run the [TryOutRook script](https://gist.github.com/joshuacox/30c0b0871622b233195a8bb5229ee5e4).

## Grab the script

`curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/joshuacox/30c0b0871622b233195a8bb5229ee5e4/raw/920183b3d5462900bd66d26ef2e106944a26d74a/gistfile1.txt -o bootstrap`{{execute}}

You should now have that script as a file named `bootstrap` in the editor
pane to the right. -->

# Other branches

You can use another branch of rook from  the repo by exporting
`ROOK_BRANCH` beforehand.

 i.e.
`export ROOK_BRANCH=master`{{execute}}
