#### Creating nested layout components

In [part 3](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-three/) of the official tutorial you learn about
creating nested layout components.

Again you will need to stop the `gatsby develop` process from the previous step.  (Click in the terminal pane on the right and `ctrl-c`)

Let's return to our home directory

`cd`{{execute}}

`gatsby new tutorial-part-three https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world`{{execute}}

`cd tutorial-part-three`{{execute}}

`npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typography react-typography typography typography-theme-fairy-gates`{{execute}}

Now let's restart it to include the new plugins.

`gatsby develop`{{execute}}
