#### Styling in Gatsby

In [part 2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/) of the official tutorial you learn
 how to style gatsby.

I'll have all the commands queued up for you below, but you'll still need to make the edits using the editor pane to the right.

You will need to stop the `gatsby develop` process from the previous step.  (Click in the terminal pane on the right and `ctrl-c`)

Let's return to our home directory

`cd`{{execute}}

`gatsby new tutorial-part-two https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world`{{execute}}

`cd tutorial-part-two`{{execute}}

And restart gatsby:

`gatsby develop --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0`{{execute}}
