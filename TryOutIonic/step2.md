## Initialize a directory for Ionic, build, and serve

This time we'll install a ionic starter and go from there.

Show Ionic help:

`ionic start --help`{{execute}}

The `ionic start` command will initialize an ionic directory.

`ionic start myApp blank --type=react `{{execute}}

then change directory into your new starter:

`cd myApp`{{execute}}

Build and Serve in Developer mode:

`ionic serve --port 80 --external --address 0.0.0.0`{{execute}}

You should now be able to view ionic on port 80.
