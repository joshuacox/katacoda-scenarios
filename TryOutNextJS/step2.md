## Initialize a directory for Next, build, and serve

We'll follow the official [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/docs) to get a NextJS Test Site

I'll have all the commands queued up for you below, but you'll still need to follow along the tutorial.

First create a new `nextjs-test` site:

`npx create-next-app`{{execute}}

Assuming you called your project `nextjs-test`:

`cd nextjs-test`{{execute}}

`npm run dev -- -p 80`{{execute}}

You should now be able to view your test site on port 80
