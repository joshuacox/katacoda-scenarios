Now back on your fork of the repo. 

You will see a section labeled `Your recently pushed branches.`

See a screenshot here.

On the right side of this section will be a button labeled
`Compare & pull request`. Click this button. You will be taken to a
`Open a pull request` page. Here you will fill out a title field and a
description for your pull request.  You should give it a title that will
immediately identify what this pull request is about.  In this case,
something like `Adding YOUR_NAME to the certified.md` is appropriate.
Then give a more verbose description in the `Leave a comment` field.

Finally click the `Create pull request` button.

Now your pull request should show up
[here.](https://github.com/GitCertifiedCollaborator/PullRequestCertification/pulls)

Then I will be notified, and you will be added to the list of certified
pull requesters which you can find
[here](https://github.com/GitCertifiedCollaborator/PullRequestCertification/blob/master/certified.md)!

Congratulations you are now a certified git collaborator who has proven
that you too can make a pull request like a professional.
